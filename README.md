Binance Exchange API wrapper

## Install
```
  git clone https://github.com/brtkev/binance-wrapper
  pip install .
```

## TESTING

testing requires you to set up a "keys.json" file on the root folder if you want to test the fuctions
that make calls using the api and secret key.

```
//keys.json
{
  "API" : "your-api-key",
  "SECRET" : "your-secret-key"
}
```
